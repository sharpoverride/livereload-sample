# NodejsConsoleApp1
I've tried to see how far the NodeJS Tools for Visual Studio have evolved.

At RC2 now, and evrything feels smooth.

I created a simple Gulpfile that loads taks automatically from /tasks.
I wired less, and watch-less to it.
I added connect and configured live reload. You just need to issue gulp watch-html
